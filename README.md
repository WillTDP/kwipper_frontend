This is the frontend for our bachelor thesis called Kwipper. Feel free to take a little peek.

Our goal is to make it cheaper and more sustainable for people to go on vacations, organise events and much more.

In this repository you can see our little front-end. Feel free to take a look.
Be sure to also check out the back-end code for local server usage: https://github.com/zegher/kwipper_back
